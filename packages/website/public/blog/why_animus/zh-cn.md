# Why Animus

The phrase "Nothing is true, everything is permitted" is often associated with the philosophical and historical order of the Assassins, a group known for their clandestine operations and the pursuit of freedom. 

However, this phrase can also be seen as a reflection of the core tenets of liberalism, which advocates for individual liberty, autonomy, and the rejection of absolute truths. 

In this essay, we will explore the paradoxical nature of this statement from a liberal perspective, dividing our discussion into three parts: the rejection of absolutes, the affirmation of individual freedom, and the implications of such a philosophy on society.

## The Rejection of Absolutes

### Liberalism

Liberalism, as a political and moral philosophy, is grounded in skepticism towards absolutes. The idea that "nothing is true" challenges the notion of objective reality and absolute truth, suggesting that what we perceive as truth is often a construct of our individual or collective experiences. 

This skepticism is not a call to nihilism, but rather an invitation to critical thinking and the acceptance of multiple perspectives. It encourages individuals to question established norms and to recognize the subjective nature of truth.

## Rejection

The rejection of absolutes in liberalism is not a denial of truth, but a recognition of its complexity. It acknowledges that truth is not a fixed entity but a dynamic concept that evolves with human understanding. This approach allows for the possibility of change and growth, as it does not confine us to a single, unyielding interpretation of reality.

## The Affirmation of Individual Freedom

The second part of our discussion focuses on the affirmation of individual freedom, encapsulated by the phrase "everything is permitted." While this may initially seem to suggest a license for anarchy or moral relativism, within the context of liberalism, it is a call for the recognition of individual autonomy and the right to self-determination.

Liberalism asserts that each person has the right to make choices about their own life, free from undue interference from the state or other individuals. This includes the freedom of thought, expression, and the pursuit of one's own happiness. It is the belief that individuals are best positioned to understand their own needs and desires and should be allowed to act in accordance with them, within the bounds of respect for the rights of others.

This affirmation of freedom is not without its challenges. It requires a delicate balance between individual rights and the common good, necessitating a robust system of laws and social norms that protect individual liberties while maintaining social order.

## The Implications for Society

The final part of our discussion examines the implications of the philosophy "Nothing is true, everything is permitted" on society. When applied to the collective, this philosophy can lead to a society that values diversity, creativity, and innovation. It encourages a culture of open-mindedness and tolerance, where differing opinions and lifestyles are not only accepted but celebrated.

However, the implications are not without their complexities. A society that rejects absolutes and affirms individual freedom must also grapple with the potential for moral ambiguity and the absence of a shared moral compass. It must find ways to foster a sense of community and shared values without resorting to enforced conformity or dogmatism.

Moreover, the liberal society must ensure that the freedom it espouses does not lead to the exploitation or harm of the vulnerable. It must establish safeguards against the abuse of power and the erosion of rights, ensuring that freedom is not merely a privilege of the few but a reality for all.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the phrase "Nothing is true, everything is permitted" when viewed through the lens of liberalism, presents a paradox that challenges us to question the nature of truth and the extent of individual freedom. It is a philosophy that demands a society that is open to change, respects individual autonomy, and is vigilant in protecting the rights of all its members. While it may seem to offer a radical departure from traditional values, it is, in essence, a call for a society that is more inclusive, more adaptable, and more attuned to the evolving needs of its people.

This essay has explored the complexities and nuances of this philosophy, highlighting its potential to foster a more open and free society, while also acknowledging the challenges it presents. As we continue to navigate the ever-changing landscape of human experience, the principles of liberalism offer a framework for understanding and embracing the paradox of freedom.
