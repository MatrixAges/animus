# Animus

Animus is an experimental project positioned between academic research and practical application. Its purpose is to simulate the human brain, leveraging the capabilities of large models and a series of infrastructures. The objective is to explore pathways towards achieving general intelligence while maintaining a balance among "intelligence", "speed", and "consumption".

## The origin of Animus

Animus (ˈænɪməs), derived from the Latin word for "spirit" , "mind" or "soul" refers to the "inner spirit, thought, or life force" within a person.

In Carl Jung's analytical psychology, "Animus" and "Anima" respectively refer to the more masculine "rationality" and the more feminine "feeling". Jung believed that a man needs to integrate his Anima to develop emotional and relational capacities, while a woman needs to integrate her Animus to develop reason and spiritual strength, ultimately achieving psychological wholeness and balance.
