# Animus

Animus is an experimental project positioned between academic research and practical application. Its purpose is to simulate the human brain, leveraging the capabilities of large models and a series of infrastructures. The objective is to explore pathways towards achieving general intelligence while maintaining a balance among "intelligence", "speed", and "power consumption".

## The origin of Animus

Animus (ˈænɪməs), derived from the Latin word for "spirit," "mind," or "soul," refers to the "inner spirit, thought, or life force" within a person.

In Carl Jung's analytical psychology, "Animus" and "Anima" refer to "reason" and "feeling," respectively. Jung believed that men need to integrate their Anima to develop emotional and relational abilities, while women need to integrate their Animus to develop reason and spiritual strength, ultimately achieving psychological wholeness and balance.
