**Animus License Agreement**

This software ("Animus Software") is licensed under the terms of the **Apache License, Version 2.0** ("Apache 2.0 License"). This License Agreement is intended to supplement the Apache 2.0 License, and in cases of conflict between the terms of the Apache 2.0 License and the terms of this Agreement, for the specific circumstances outlined below, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. Please note that certain terms in this Agreement may impose additional restrictions on rights typically granted under the Apache 2.0 License, particularly regarding commercial redistribution of modified works and the retention of Animus brand identity.

**I. Commercial Use and Redistribution**

1.    **Commercial Use Permitted Under Apache 2.0 License:**
      You may use, reproduce, and redistribute the Animus Software for commercial purposes under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License, subject to the following restrictions:

      - **Unmodified Animus Software:** You may commercially use and redistribute the original, unmodified version of the Animus Software.
      - **Internal Modifications and Use:** You may modify the Animus Software for your own internal commercial purposes and use and distribute these modified versions within your organization, provided that these modified versions are not redistributed to any third party.
      - **Branding and Attribution:** In all the above cases, you must fully retain all original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices contained within the Animus Software.

2.    **Commercial Redistribution Requiring Additional Commercial License:**

      - If you wish to **redistribute** any modified version of the Animus Software to any third party for the purpose of deriving direct or indirect commercial benefit (including, but not limited to, selling it as a standalone product, integrating it into commercial services or products, or otherwise generating revenue from it), you must first contact the Animus Development Team to obtain a separate **Commercial License**.
      - This Commercial License will be an agreement independent of the Apache 2.0 License and may involve a paid authorization to grant you the right to undertake such commercial redistribution.
      - Furthermore, any commercial promotion and redistribution of proprietary products based on the Animus Software that use materials not conforming to official Animus brand guidelines or that may cause user confusion, also require compliance with this clause and necessitate obtaining additional authorization.

3.    **Multi-tenant Services:**

      - Unless you have obtained written authorization from Animus, you must not use the Animus source code to operate a multi-tenant environment. (Tenant Definition: In the context of Animus, one tenant corresponds to one workspace. This workspace provides an independent space for each tenant's data and configuration.)

4.    **Retention of Brand Identity and Copyright Information:**
      - Regardless of the license under which you use or distribute the Animus Software, you shall not delete, hide, or modify any explicitly displayed Animus LOGO, brand identity, product name, or copyright information within the Animus console or application without prior written authorization from the Animus Development Team. This includes, but is not limited to, Animus brand elements clearly marked in splash screens, about pages, interaction methods, and other user interface elements.

**II. Contributor Agreement**

As a contributor to Animus, you agree to the following terms:

1.    **License Adjustment**: The producer reserves the right to adjust the open-source license as needed, making it more stringent or lenient.
2.    **Commercial Use**: Your contributed code may be used for commercial purposes, including, but not limited to, cloud business operations.

**III. Other Terms**

1.    The right to interpret the terms of this Agreement rests with the Animus developers.
2.    This Agreement may be updated based on actual circumstances, and users will be notified of updates through this software.
3.    This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
